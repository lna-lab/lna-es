**The Fundamental Question**

Should I continue living, or should I end my life? That's the question I'm facing. Is it more honorable to endure all the terrible things that life throws at you, or to fight back against all these problems and, by fighting them, put an end to them? To die would be like going to sleepâ€”nothing more. And by sleeping, we could say we've ended all the heartache and the thousands of painful experiences that human beings have to go through. It's an ending we'd deeply wish for.

**The Fear of the Unknown**

To die, to sleep. To sleep, and maybe to dreamâ€”ah, that's the problem. Because in that sleep of death, what dreams might come when we've left our physical bodies behind? That's what makes us pause and think. That's the consideration that makes us put up with a life full of disasters for so long.

**Society's Problems**

Who would choose to bear all of life's burdensâ€”the abuse from those in power, the arrogance of proud people, the pain of unreturned love, the slowness of the legal system, the rudeness of government officials, and the disrespect that patient, deserving people receive from those who don't deserve their positions? Who would carry these heavy burdens, groaning and sweating through a exhausting life, if it weren't for the fear of something after death?

**The Paralysis of Overthinking**

That unknown country from which no traveler ever returnsâ€”this puzzles our will and makes us choose to bear the troubles we know rather than flee to others we don't know about. This is how our conscience makes cowards of us all. And this is how our natural tendency toward decisive action gets weakened by too much thinking, and important enterprises that should be undertaken get their momentum redirected and lose their chance for action.

**A Gentle Interruption**

But waitâ€”here comes the beautiful Ophelia! In your prayers, please remember all my sins and ask for forgiveness.

"Hello, my lord. How have you been all these days?"

"I'm fine, thank you. Well, well, well.

**Gifts from a Different Time**

"My lord, I have some things that belonged to you, things I've wanted to return to you for a long time. Please, take them back now."

"No, I didn't give you anything."

"My respected lord, you know very well that you did. And along with them, you gave me words so beautifully spoken that they made the gifts even more precious. But their sweetness is gone now. Take these back, because to a noble heart, rich gifts become worthless when the givers prove to be unkind.

**Probing Questions**

"Are you honest?"

"What do you mean, my lord?"

"Are you beautiful?"

"What are you trying to say?"

"If you're both honest and beautiful, your honesty shouldn't allow you to spend time with your beauty.

**The Confession of Changed Feelings**

"Yes, it's trueâ€”beauty has more power to turn an honest person into a cheater than honesty has power to make a beautiful person good. This used to seem impossible, but now we see proof of it. I did love you once."

"Indeed, my lord, you made me believe that."

"You shouldn't have believed me. Because human nature is so fundamentally corrupted that even virtue can't completely change usâ€”we'll still have traces of our original sin. I didn't love you.

**Protective Cruelty**

"I was deceived then."

"Go to a convent. Why would you want to bring more sinners into the world? I'm reasonably honest myself, but I could accuse myself of such terrible things that it would have been better if my mother had never given birth to me. I'm very proud, vengeful, and ambitious, with more faults available to me than I have thoughts to think them, imagination to picture them, or time to act on them. What should people like me be doing, crawling around between earth and heaven? We're all complete scoundrels. Don't believe any of us.

**The Final Warning**

"Go to a convent, and go quickly. If you do get married, I'll give you this curse as your wedding gift: even if you're as pure as ice and as clean as snow, you won't escape being slandered. Get to a convent, go. Or if you absolutely must marry, marry someone stupid, because smart men know exactly what kind of monsters you women turn them into. To a convent, go, and quickly too. Goodbye.
